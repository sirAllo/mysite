        <p>The Cahabaan Community
Cahabaan is one of the 15 barangays comprising the town of Talisay,
Camarines Norte. It covers 190 ha, which is divided into three purok or zones.
A barangay census conducted in. 1984 placed the barangay population at 494
(258 females and 236 males), distributed in 91 households.
In 1987, houses were built far apart and were accessible by foot trails across
coconut lands. There was no discernible built-up area. It had neither a school
nor a chapel which, in many Philippine villages, served as centers) of community
activities. Village children attended school in nearby barangays or in Daet, the
provincial capital, less than 2 km away. Cahabaan was not accessible by public
transport; it could be reached only by taking the passenger jeepneys plying the
nearby villages or by hiring a tricycle from Talisay or Daet.
Other basic services were also wanting in the area. Electric service was
enjoyed by only ten residents; the majority were dependent on kerosene for their
light: Domestic water was provided by a few hand pumps and several open
wells. Laundering and bathing were generally done in the irrigation canal which
traversed Cahabaan.
The village has a generally plain terrain, with an average elevation of about
10 m above sea level. Its soil type is classified as San Miguel clay loam. The
area has no distinct dry season, but rainfall is heaviest between October and
January, which are also considered typhoon months.
The majority of Cahabaan households depended principally on farming. They
cultivated over 90 percent of the barangay land. Mostly share tenants, the
farming households grew coconut as a major crop. Rice was another important
crop; it was grown for home consumption as well as for. the market. Farmers
planted the high-yielding, early-maturing rice varieties. Another cash crop was
pole sitao, planted in rainfed and open areas. (Until the 1960s, abaca was the
major cropfgrown in Cahabaan. But when an infestation wiped out the standing
crop, farmers shifted to coconut instead of replanting their lands to abaca.)
Apart from growing crops, Cahabaan households raised chickens, pigs,
carabaos, and/or cows. Pigs and cows were bred or fattened for the market. In

2

contrast, carabaos were usually intended for draft power, while chickens were
raised for home consumption although they were sold when necessary.
Agricultural production in the village rarely ceased. Coconuts, which were
generally processed into copra, were harvested seven to eight times a year, after
an interval of about 45 days. In rainfed and open areas, rice farming usually
began in October or November; harvest, in late January. Pole sitao was
cultivated year round, although some households grew this crop only after the
rice crop, that is, from January to May.
Resources
Owners of large tracts of land in Cahabaan included agricultural compradores
(traders) based in Daet. Individuals or households which desired to farm could
acquire land either through outright purchase or by entering into any of the
following land'-use arrangements: share tenancy, leasehold or the payment of a
fixed rent, subtenancy or subletting for a specified season, or borrowing for a
short period. These arrangements varied depending on the degree of
permanency the tiller families entered into. Tenancy rights could be transferred
from one generation of tillers to another; thus, second-generation tenants
assumed tenancy rights to the land, and second-generation landlords inherited
their parents' tenants. In another arrangement, land contracts had a specific time
duration and were nonrenewable for the succeeding period.
Some of the land-use contracts in the village had been negotiated by both the
women and their spouses. In a few cases, land was acquired by the woman from
her parents or siblings as a wedding gift or as an inheritance. In other cases, the
men had acquired land by directly negotiating with the owners or through the
transfer of tenancy rights from their fathers. Where land was privately owned by
couples, land was generally considered as conjugal property.
Cahabaan households usually needed cash to buy farm inputs (fertilizers),
hire laborers, replenish stocks, buy medicine for their animals, and finance
enterprises that required periodic cash outlays. Farm and household operations
were usually financed out of the households' livestock or crop sales. Cash was
raised by selling copra, vegetables, fruits, livestock, and chickens. Additional
cash was also earned by the women's vending activities, including the selling of
food delicacies (nata de coco, cassava cake, and atchara [pickled green papaya])
which they or other village women prepared.
The men also earned cash income from wage jobs in Cahabaan rice farms,
while the women and children derived cash from off-farm employment. Some
children, mainly the females, worked as domestics outside the village. They often
sent part of their wages home; they also sometimes went home themselves
during harvest time to help out in the family farm.

When village households needed to obtain cash loans, the transaction was
negotiated by either the women or the men. Loans from relatives, however, were
often secured by the women, but they or their husbands could get cash loans
from comprada '(crop trading stations) on the promise that they would sell
forthcoming crops to them. While female and male spouses were equally
involved in securing production loans, the women were more active in raising
funds for household needs, especially if this meant borrowing from neighbors or
relatives.
Several households were able to obtain credit from livelihood projects that had
credit components. Some also tapped the farming systems project, not for cash,
but for palay seeds which they paid back after the harvest. In the case of (cash
or noncash) loans from projects, the household member who was qualified to join
the project obtained the loan. Bank loans, the villagers claimed, were avoided
because these usually required a collateral which they could not provide.

Division and sharing of work
The division of farm tasks depended on two factors: labor availability, and the
technology and the physical strength used in the activity. Tilling the soil could
require the use of draft animals and plows and harrows, or it could require hoes
or bolos. Where land preparation involved draft power and its attendant
implements, this operation was done by male workers, the father and/ or adult
sons. But while the males did the breaking of the soil with a harrow or a plow,
the women were observed clearing and preparing the land with the use of bolos
and hoes. Similarly, although the men generally applied the chemicals and
fertilizers, the women helped with the application of granular fertilizers. The
women often attended to the postharvest processing of crops such as rice, corn,
and mung beans. However, it was the men who harvested and processed
coconut into copra, while the women counted and weighed the nuts.
Some cultivation tasks could be and were done by either female or male
labor, depending on who were on hand to do the task. Examples included tasks
which tended to be done by women but which could also involve men, such as
transplanting, weeding, and harvesting of rice. Activities associated with pole
sitao cultivation, such as the construction and installation of posts and trellises,
were operations generally performed by men but which had sometimes been
done by women. Similarly, planting, weeding, thinning, and the management of
the pole sitao crop—tasks often done by women—could likewise be done by men.
While female and male labor were substitutable, the relative time allocated
for the care of specific crops varied among household members. This variation
was partly associated with the "ownership" of the crop. Crops grown by adult
children were their own, and these children tended to work on these more than
did other members. However, for household crops, the couple decided on what

4
to plant, where, and when. The men attended to the households' "traditional" or
usual food and cash crops, but specific cultivation activities were shared with
other household members. In some cases as well, the women experimented with
or initiated the growing of new food crops, particularly vegetables (okra and
pechay) and spices (pepper), partly for the market and partly to ensure the
availability of ingredients for their meals. The women took the responsibility of
raising these crops; but, as in cultivating other crops, their spouses or their
children were called on to undertake specific tasks in the trial plots.
The children were most active in the care of poultry, pigs, and other livestock.
The boys herded carabaos and cows to graze, wallow, and drink; the girls fed the
fowls. Both the male and the female children helped their parents gather and
prepare feed for their animals. They also carried water from wells, hand pumps,
or creeks for the animals as well as for household use.
The accomplishment of various home chores was dependent on the women
and their daughters, although the male spouses and the sons helped with specific
tasks. The adult males undertook house repairs and brought in water and fuel.
They also looked after the young children when they were home. But when the
men were absent, the women and the children took over even the male tasks,
albeit in lesser volume. Moreover, the women and the older daughters usually
cooked the meals, washed the laundry, kept the house clean, mended clothes,
preserved food, and did other home-bound chores. They also took care of the
children, often interspersing this with other tasks. The young children secured
ingredients for household meals from their farm or from neighbors.
While gender work-roles at home were generally flexible, an implicit tenet—
whoever is available does a chore—nonetheless saddled females with the
housework. More house-bound than the males, the females ended up being
it for all the home chores.
Apart from farming and housework, a number of women in Cahabaan brought
their harvest to the market; they engaged in trading in farm produce, buying
vegetables or fruits in the village and selling these in Daet. A few other women
either ran stores in the village or sold trinkets and, other things along the
sidewalks of Daet. Still other women prepared food delicacies which they
themselves brought to the market or which the poorer women in the village
marketed for them. So diffused was the nature of their work that the women
themselves were confused as to whether their work was "nonwork." Nonetheless,
the women in Cahabaan spent a much longer time both in livelihood and
household production than their spouses or children did. Their average
workweek was about 97 hours (42 hours in farm and market work, -and 55 hours
in housework) which was more than double the 43-hour workweek computed for
the men (35 hours in farm and other market work, and 8 hours in housework).
Likewise, the sons were working shorter hours per week (24 hours each, with 7

5
hours spent at home) compared to the daughters (32 hours each, -with 23 hours
in housework). This gender-differentiated work schedule resulted in males
indulging in more leisure activities (such as watching and betting in cockfights,
discussing political and other issues, and the like) than the females. The women,
however, got together during trips to the market and group work in the fields, and
on occasions like christenings, weddings, and wakes. On these special events,
the women did their socializing while helping prepare the food.

Control over resources
The women in Cahabaan usually brought the vegetables, coconut harvest, or
copra to the market, with their spouses or sons charged with transporting the
goods. They also often brought the harvest from their children's plots along with
the household crops (that is, those grown in the household farm and vegetable
plots). The women kept the proceeds from the household crops and exercised
discretion in their disbursement. In contrast, they turned over the earning&from
their children's crops to the children concerned, and waited for the latter to
volunteer to share their earnings with the household.
Wages in the form of palay were usually added to the household larder, but
cash earnings were usually disbursed by the producer or worker as they wished.
However, wages earned by the couple were generally spent on household needs,
although the proportion of the wages allotted for household upkeep varied
between the women and their spouses. The men generally retained a portion of
their wages for their personal needs such as cigarettes and liquor, and, for some,
as gambling wagers. In contrast, the majority of the women plowed back
whatever they earned for the family upkeep like food, clothes, their children's
education, and things for the house. Similarly, female traders disbursed their
trading or vending profits for household expenses. The women added their
spouses' earnings and their children's contributions to the household fund, which
would cover immediate household and/or farm needs.
In disbursing household funds, the women claimed that they attended to their
children's needs first, especially in the matter of food, education, and clothing.
The women and, sometimes, also the men, had to make do with their old clothes
and/or with castoffs from relatives. Whenever surpluses or windfalls occurred, the
couples decided on investments which they could make, such as a piece of land,
additional livestock, or consumer items for the house.

Involvement in community activities
The villagers' involvement in community activities took two forms: one,
participation in informal group activities, usually with relatives, friends, and/or
immediate neighbors; the other, attendance in village meetings and formal village
activities. The first usually took place over pitchers of tuba (coconut wine), with

6
the women on one side of the gathering, sharing domestic and farming problems
while the men discussed politics, economics, and farm issues. Couples also
helped out friends and relatives to reciprocate any form of assistance extended
to them.
Formal village affairs, of which development projects are examples, tended to
draw the men more frequently than they did the women. While the women
usually attended village assemblies convened principally for the (male) household
heads, they usually considered themselves as miron, or interested observers.
Occasionally, projects for women were initiated. Examples of these were
mothers' classes and home management sessions conducted by a home management technician (HMT) from the provincial agriculture office. These sessions,
however, were generally attended by selected women who were either barangay
zone leaders, spouses of barangay leaders, or other relatively well-off women.
Meanwhile, many women who were not invited to the meetings viewed these as
competing with their already heavy workload.

Women and the Cahabaan Project
The Cahabaan farming systems project was launched in 1984; by 1986, the
project cooperators had already undertaken trials over a year. It focused on
project planning and design, and the conduct of on-farm and other research trials
on crop production, crop-livestock integration, and income-generating projects.
To support its research activities, the project also organized farmers' classes,
seminars, and field visits. It further elicited the participation of target farmers as
well as other groups in the community in the planning and implementation of its
activities. While some activities involved groups of farmers and other residents
in the village, the project focused on individual farmers and their households.

Project planning and design
Site assessment. The first activity launched by the project in a village was
site assessment. In Cahabaan, it was participated in by residents, who, except
for one, were all males and members of the barangay council. Like her male
peers, the lone female barangay council member assisted the project team in
preparing the community profile, served as a guide during walkthroughs of her
zone, acted as an informant on specific topics about Cahabaan, and helped the
project in identifying potential project cooperators. She likewise organized a
meeting of farmers in her zone during which the project staff explained the
project. Her husband was one of those who attended the meeting.
Based on the profile and results of the onsite investigations, the project staff
identified the particular kinds of crops to be incorporated in the various on-farm
trials related to alternative cropping patterns, the production of new crops through

8
multistory planting, and pole sitao varietal trials. Identified cooperators were then
matched with the types of trials planned. In assigning trials to cooperators, two
suitability factors were considered: physical features and location (that is, it
should be easily accessible to the project team members). The project then
sought the farmers' agreement regarding the use of the area selected for the trial
plots. This was an issue which was easily settled because the areas chosen were
either previously not cultivated or were planted to the same type of crop for which
some testing was considered necessary.
Selection of cooperators. The project cooperators were chosen from among
farmers who have had long-term experience in a sustained and extensive crop or
livestock prodction, and who held regular cultivation rights to a parcel which
could be used as a project trial plot. Their selection was made by the project
staff in consultation with village leaders and with the concurrence of the identified
cooperators.
The leaders were asked to either recommend or assess candidate farmers.
They were also asked to accompany the project staff in visits to the farms of
prospective cooperators so that the project staff could determine the suitability of
the areas to the planned on-farm trials. Several leaders reportedly felt
"compelled TM to become cooperators because they believed that they were
expected to serve as models to other farmers by virtue of their leadership
position. In 1986, all the 29 cooperators chosen were males. The female
spouses of four cooperators and a widow were also selected for an integrated
crop (peanuts) and income-generating project (peanut-butter making) activity.
The females, however, were generally chosen for the women-specific activities
(see section on the Women Component).

On-farm trials
The on-farm trials engaged farmer-cooperators in the production of new crops
(black pepper, peanuts, and cacao) through multistory planting, the care of new
animals (goats), and testing of modified cropping patterns. Some cooperators
also tried new varieties of pole sitao.
The project supplied most of the inputs for the trials: seedlings, fertilizers, and
pesticides for the crop production-related activities; and goats, planting materials
(for the pasture lot), and medicine for the livestock component. The project staff
also rendered technical assistance in setting up the trials. Meanwhile, the farmers
provided the plots (1,000 to 2,000 sq m each) and the labor. To accommodate
the tasks needed for the trial plots, the project cooperators sometimes had to
change their cropping calendars not only in the trial plots but in their other parcels
as well. And when the project timetable clashed with the cooperators' own farm
schedule, the farmers sometimes hired laborers to work on the trial plots, or
deployed female household members who would not usually perform tasks like

9
land preparation or the installation of trellises. Members of the household spent
time preparing and planting the trial plots and caring for and harvesting the crop.
Cooperators involved in the crop-livestock integration project found it necessary
not only to care for the goats, but to establish pasture lots and construct
goathouses. In one case reported by the livestock specialist, the female spouse
of a cooperator who was given goats returned the animals because their care
added work to her already long day.
In return for their participation in the project, the farmer-cooperators kept the
produce of the trials although, sometimes, a part of it was given to the project as
payment for its inputs in the trials. For the crop-livestock integration activities,
cooperators were required to give an equal number of does from the second
kidding of the goats.

Women component
The project sought the participation of the Cahabaan women in several
women-specific, home-management types of activities. A female HMT engaged
the women cooperators in testing income-generating home industries. The
activities were coordinated through the Rural Improvement Club (RIO) which the
HMT activated during the first weeks of her assignment to the site.
The women component of the project included homemakers' classes.
Between February 1985 and February 1986, 15 sessions were held in the village.
These were attended by 12 to 26 women, most of whom were R1C members.
During these sessions, the HMT and invited resource persons demonstrated
cooking procedures for food recipes using locally available ingredients; this was
meant to improve the nutrient content and variety of the household diet (by
including foods such as rootcrop salad, pineapple jam, and coconut sauce) as
well as those of food items (such as nata de coco [sweetened coconut gel],
salted eggs, and peanut butter) which the women could prepare for the market.
From among the RIC members, the HMT selected the women who would be
involved in the project's income-generating home industry projects, namely,
peanut-butter making and nata de coco production. Three women cooperators
were chosen for peanut-butter making; and seven, for nata de coco processing.
The HMT supervised the women's activities and helped secure a market for their
products.
The cooperators of the nate de coco production purchased the "mother liquor"
and acetic acid, the major ingredients, from the Daet market. Similarly, the
women producing peanut-butter had to buy peanuts from Daet. Peanuts were
relatively more expensive (than mother liquor) and these were not usually grown
in Cahabaan. The HMT discussed the problem with other members of the project
staff, particularly the crops specialist. In May 1986, peanuts were introduced and
integrated into the cropping system of the women's households
